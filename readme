To run the tests is necessary to install:
  NVM with version 1.2.2
  NPM 10.9.2
  NODE 23.11.0

To run, open cmd or terminal, go to file directory and run:
  npx playwright test --ui (to run with UI helper)

The first test is working
The second I could not validate because the web page has a bug that when you click to Edit a Form Builder,
the page loads but also the three loading dots keep in the background, preventing the playwright tool to run
the tests properly.
I will try to add screenshots to ilustrate what is happening.
To see what happened look at the two pictures that are in this Repo
